<h2>About Me:</h2>
<p>
  I graduated from California State University - Dominguez Hills in Spring 2021 with a B.S in Mathematics and Computer Science. I have always been interested in tinkering with computers. During my break from school, I found a technical support job and enjoyed the problem solving aspect alot. Eventually, I found my interest in Machine Learning & A.I. The topic garnered my interest by how similar I found the 'learning' process to my own learning methodology. 
</p>
<h2>Goal(s)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Get into research 
 <ul>
   <li>Read more articles surrounding(computer vision, graph neural networks, reinforcement learning) </li>
 </ul>
 </li>
<li>Do more projects centered around teaching and research interests
  <ul>
    <li><b>"Linear Algebra & Optimization for Machine Learning" </b>by Aggarwal  </li>
     <li>Computer Vision project with a Raspberry Pi camera </li>

  </ul>

<h2>Research Experience(s):</h2>
<h4>CAHSI vREU - Summer 2021 </h4>
<dt class ="tab">>> I got to work with Professor Bin Tang from CSUDH as my mentor. The topics explored during the program was setting the foundation for reinforcement learning, multiagent learning, and implemented the classic Q-Learning algorithm. We also worked with others to discuss ideas and to test our understanding surrounding Value functions and policies. After I implemented a modified Q-Learning algorithm in Python to mimic cooperative learning in a KxK sensor network. With this program, I got to present a research poster for the GMiS Conference(10/15/2021). My full abstract can be found <ahref="https://www.github.com/">here</a> and research poster <a href="https://www.github.com/">here</a>
 </dt>

<h4>CSUDH LSAMP - Spring 2021 </h4>
<dt class ="tab">>> My project was centered around detecting accurate heartbeats using Matlab. Profesor Wang was my LSAMP mentor and helped me become more familiar with Matlab and let me explore my own ideas on how to approach the problem. I was given the current signal fusion algorithm that helps detects heartbeats by evaluating the peaks from ECG and ABP signals.

 </dt>

<h4>Resesarch Assitant- Fall 2019 </h4>
<dt class ="tab">>> I was able to have my professor give me a peek at what research life was like. This was where I learned how to read and dissect published papers, and identify what key ideas we can potentially improve upon. I also gave presentations surrounding papers I covered. Examples can be found <ahref="https://www.github.com/">here</a>
